### Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GabrieleRomeo/ES6-Professional-starter-kit.git
cd ES6-Professional-starter-kit
```



Update the project's information inside the `package.json` file and, if necessary, [clear out](https://gist.github.com/stephenhardy/5470814) the git history of the original repo.



After that, you can start fresh with `semantic-release` by invoking the `setup` task, like this:



Run `yarn setup` or `npm run setup` 



You may also run dependencies installation manually with:

Run `yarn` or `npm install` 





### Build

By default the `src/index.js` file acts as a single point of access for the build system.

The `build` directory will contain the `build.js` and `build.min.js` files. The former will be a production version of your software that you will ship and the latter will be a development version instead.



Check out the comments inside the  `webpack.config.js` file If you want to use your library directly into the browser.





### Development Environment

Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` 

 It will open the `index.html` page within your favourite browser. 



### Documentation

JSDoc allows to use a markdown file as the home of your API. By default, the system uses the `home_manifest.md` file under the `__jsDoc__` dir as to generate the example.



### Semantic Release

To release a new version, you'll need to create a commit with `Changelog` type. 

To generate changelog draft run `npm run changelog:preview`.

To commit changelog run `npm run changelog:commit`.
