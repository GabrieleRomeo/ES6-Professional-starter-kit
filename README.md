### Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GabrieleRomeo/ES6-Professional-starter-kit.git
cd ES6-Professional-starter-kit
```



Update the project's information inside the `package.json` 



After that, you can start fresh with `semantic-release` by invoking the `setup` task, like this:

```shell
yarn setup
// or
npm run setp
```

 Otherwise you can run the dependencies installation manually:

```shell
yarn
// or
npm install
```



### Run in development mode

```shell
yarn dev
// or
npm run dev
```

Goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)



### Build

The `build` directory will contain the `build.js` and `build.min.js` files. The former will be a production version of your software that you will ship and the latter will be a development version instead.

If you want to request your library directly into the browser, check out the comments inside the  `webpack.config.js` file to see how you can configure the Webpack's output to achieve different results.
